    // HTTP communication is synchronous - you send a request and you get a
    // response. With messaging the situation is different - a consumer
    // suddenly might get a message. In the consumer tests the consumer needs a
    // mean to trigger that message. That hook is called a label in Spring
    // Cloud Contract. Letâ€™s call our label accepted_verification. To define it
    // in the contract just call the label method like this label
    // 'accepted_verification'
    label "accepted_verification"
